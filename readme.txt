Intro 
=========================
I am twelve years old. This ended up as just a fun project. I mean, who wouldnt want to write an iOS app?
I cant  really afford an apple developers license, but when I saw the 2014 Kivy Contest I knew i was going to enter anyway, even if the app would never see the light of the app store.
 I am proud of creating this app and entering it in the Kivy Contest. This was an amazing experience
to learn the ropes of Kivy!

Installation
=========================
This application requires Kivy 1.8.0 (of course) along with the builtin Python module Pickle.
Enjoy!

I am twelve years old, this started out as just a fun project. I mean, who wouldnt want to write an iOS app?
I cant  really afford an apple developers license, but when I saw the 2014 Kivy Contest I knew i was going to 
do it anyway. I am proud of creating this app and entering it in the Kivy Contest. This was an amazing experience
to learn the ropes of Kivy!
